PS: Next time you pull the project, please reinstall it before doing anything (pip install --editable .)

Next Tasks
- Login to Github ✔️
- Create repo on github ✔️
- Clone repo locally ✔️
- Set a right path where the directory should be
- Setup login with SSH  #FIXME: Seems like this one is not permitted by the github api so I thought of something:
                        why not use a token, like at the first sign in, it will require username and password
                        then it will generate a hidden root .txt file with a token, then everytime the user wanna initialize
                        a new repo, the script will look for the root file and auto-fill the credentials.
                        Tell me what you think. (of course the token will be encrypted)
- Write tests
- Output a program description and version
