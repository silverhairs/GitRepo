# GitRepo
It is quite boring everytime typing `git init` in your local computer then go to github and initialize a new repository, take the remote url and add it to the local... I am already tired just by explaining. Thanks God **GitRepo** exists. <br/>
<br/>Gitrepo is a command-line application that automates initializing a new repository both locally and on GitHub. The user can either initialize the repository in the directory they are currently working in, or generate a brand new folder which will come initialized as a git and github repository.
